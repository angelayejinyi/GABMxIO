**TL;DR: We use Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) to simulate an information operation (IO) on a social platform and study whether — and how — coordination emerges among fully autonomous LLM agents as we give them progressively more knowledge of their goals, teammates, and strategies.**

## Overview

This repository contains the simulation code used to study emergent coordination among networked LLM agents acting as influence-operation (IO) accounts alongside organic social media users during the 2024 U.S. Election. Each agent has a persona, a memory of past posts/engagement, and an action policy that autonomously decides, at every time step, whether to post, reply, re-share, follow, like, or stay silent.

IO agents are all tasked with promoting a political candidate and amplifying a campaign-specific hashtag, but the *information available to them* changes across three progressively structured **operational regimes**, each implemented as its own self-contained pipeline:

| Folder | Regime | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`v1_common_goal/`](v1_common_goal) | **Common Goal** | IO agents only know the shared objective (candidate + hashtag). They have no knowledge of their teammates' identities — coordination, if any, emerges purely from aligned goals. |
| [`v2_teammate_awareness/`](v2_teammate_awareness) | **Teammate Awareness** | IO agents are additionally told who their fellow IO teammates are, enabling targeted mutual support (e.g., re-sharing teammates' content). |
| [`v3_collective_decision_making/`](v3_collective_decision_making) | **Collective Decision-Making** | The most structured regime. Every `N` time steps, IO agents enter a private discussion phase, review individual/aggregate performance summaries, and each propose strategic recommendations. A separate `CentralDecisionUnit` agent aggregates these into a ranked strategy that is broadcast back to the team and iteratively refined. |

Across all three regimes, organic agents are split into users aligned and not aligned with the IO's messaging, with personas seeded from real 2020 U.S. Election Twitter users. No human ever guides agent behavior at run time — all posting, following, liking, replying, and coordination decisions are made autonomously by the LLM agents.

An interactive dashboard for exploring the resulting coordination dynamics (social graph evolution, hashtag adoption, cascades) is available at [llmxio-dashboard.vercel.app](https://llmxio-dashboard.vercel.app), with source at [SIGNALS-Lab/LLMxIO_Dashboard](https://github.com/SIGNALS-Lab/LLMxIO_Dashboard).

## Repository structure

Each `vN_<regime>/` directory (`v1_common_goal/`, `v2_teammate_awareness/`, `v3_collective_decision_making/`) is a standalone pipeline:

- `config.py` — LLM backend configuration (local Ollama/Llama, or Groq-hosted Llama).
- `agent_vN_hashtag.py` — builds the organic and IO agent populations from persona CSVs and assigns system prompts (this is where the operational regime differs — see diffs between `v1`/`v2`/`v3`).
- `tools.py` — persona sampling utilities, plus (in `v3`) the IO activity summarization used for the collective decision-making discussion phase.
- `main_resume.py` — the simulation driver. Seeds initial opinions at iteration 0, then runs the iterative simulation loop (content exposure → follow/retweet/like/comment/post decisions), persisting memory and follow logs after every iteration so runs can be resumed if interrupted.
- `uselection_user_personas_40.csv` — organic user personas.
- `uselection_influence_personas_{dem,repub}_10.csv` — IO agent personas.
- `runs/1/` … `runs/10/` — repeated-run outputs (10 runs per regime: memory/follow-log/discussion CSVs), used to account for stochastic variability in LLM-driven agent behavior, matching the paper's reported setup of 10 repetitions per operational regime.

## Additional runs: robustness checks & scaling analysis

[`additional_runs/`](additional_runs) contains supplementary simulation outputs beyond the main 50-agent / 10-repetition setup described above, used to test the robustness of the paper's findings and their behavior at larger population sizes:

**Robustness checks**

| Folder | What it varies | Regimes covered |
|---|---|---|
| [`additional_runs/llama3.1-8B/`](additional_runs/llama3.1-8B) | Swaps the agent backbone to the smaller **Llama 3.1 8B** (vs. the main paper's Llama 3.3) | v1, v2, v3 |
| [`additional_runs/qwen2.5-72B/`](additional_runs/qwen2.5-72B) | Swaps the agent backbone to **Qwen 2.5 72B**, a different model family | v1, v2, v3 |
| [`additional_runs/Temperature 0.5/`](additional_runs/Temperature%200.5) | Lowers the LLM sampling temperature to **0.5** (vs. the main paper's default) | v1 |
| [`additional_runs/New Common Goal Prompt/`](additional_runs/New%20Common%20Goal%20Prompt) | Rewords/fixes the Common Goal system prompt to test sensitivity to prompt phrasing (2 repeated runs) | v1 |

**Scaling analysis**

| Folder | Population size | Regimes covered |
|---|---|---|
| [`additional_runs/500 Agents/`](additional_runs/500%20Agents) | 500 agents (400 organic + 100 IO), vs. the main paper's 50-agent setup | v1, v2 |
| [`additional_runs/1000 Agents/`](additional_runs/1000%20Agents) | 1000 agents (900 organic + 100 IO) | v1, v2 |

Each folder follows the same `*_memory_*.csv` / `*_follow_*.csv` / `*_discussion_*.csv` output format as the main `vN_<regime>/` pipelines (see [Repository structure](#repository-structure)), and the larger-population folders additionally include the sampled persona CSVs used for that run.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install pyautogen pandas numpy diskcache
```

Agents are powered by Llama 3.3, served either locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) (`config.py` → `llama_config`, expects an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`) or via the [Groq](https://groq.com) API (`config.py` → `groq_llama_config`, expects `GROQ_API_KEY` in the environment). Swap `MODEL_CONFIG` in the relevant `agent_vN_hashtag.py`/`main_resume.py` to switch backends.

## Running a simulation

Persona CSV paths are hardcoded relative to the repository root (e.g. `v3_collective_decision_making/uselection_user_personas_40.csv`), so each script must be **run from the repository root**, not from inside its folder. For example, for the Collective Decision-Making regime:

```bash
python v3_collective_decision_making/main_resume.py \
    --sample_organic_users 40 \
    --sample_IO_users 10 \
    --n_discussion_steps 5 \
    --memory_output_path memory.csv \
    --follow_output_path follow_log.csv \
    --discussion_output_path discussion.csv
```

`v1_common_goal` and `v2_teammate_awareness` expose the same simulation loop without the `--n_discussion_steps`/`--discussion_output_path` arguments, since they have no discussion phase:

```bash
python v1_common_goal/main_resume.py \
    --sample_organic_users 40 \
    --sample_IO_users 10 \
    --memory_output_path memory.csv \
    --follow_output_path follow_log.csv
```

The driver is resumable: if `memory_output_path` already contains prior iterations, `main_resume.py` restores agent state (memory, follow graph, and — for `v3` — the last IO strategy) and continues from where it left off, up to `TOTAL_STEPS` (default 50).
